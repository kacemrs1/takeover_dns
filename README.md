# Advanced Subdomain Takeover Scanner

A comprehensive Python-based security tool for subdomain discovery and takeover vulnerability detection. This tool helps identify potentially vulnerable subdomains that could be subject to domain takeover attacks.

## üîç Overview

The Advanced Subdomain Takeover Scanner is designed for **defensive security testing** of your own domains. It combines multiple subdomain discovery tools with advanced vulnerability analysis to detect potential subdomain takeover risks across various cloud platforms.

- **Comprehensive DNS Analysis**: Resolves A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, and TXT records
- **HTTP/HTTPS Response Analysis**: Checks both protocols for takeover indicators
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies vulnerabilities across 15+ cloud platforms
- **Multi-threaded Scanning**: Fast concurrent analysis with configurable thread counts
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates JSON and HTML reports with actionable findings
- **Cloud Platform Support**: Detects vulnerabilities in:
  - AWS (S3, CloudFront, ELB)
  - Azure
  - GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Pages
  - Heroku
  - Netlify
  - Vercel
  - Shopify
  - WordPress
  - Fastly
  - Pantheon
  - Tumblr
  - Ghost
  - And more...

## üö® Security Notice

**IMPORTANT**: This tool is intended for:
- ‚úÖ Testing your own domains
- ‚úÖ Authorized security assessments
- ‚úÖ Defensive security operations
- ‚úÖ Bug bounty testing (with proper authorization)

**NEVER** use this tool for unauthorized security testing. Always ensure you have explicit written permission before scanning any domain.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Tools

Before running the scanner, you need to install the following tools:

1. **subfinder**
   ```bash
   go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
   ```

2. **amass**
   - Download from: https://github.com/OWASP/Amass
   - Or install via package manager

3. **assetfinder**
   ```bash
   go install github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder@latest
   ```

4. **subjack**
   - Download from: https://github.com/haccer/subjack
   - Place `fingerprints.json` in `/path/to/subjack/`

5. **findomain** (optional)
   - Download from: https://github.com/Findomain/Findomain

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install dnspython requests
```

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the repository
cd CyberSecurity

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure all external tools are installed and in PATH
subfinder -version
amass -version
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python takeover_dns.py example.com
```

### Advanced Usage (with custom thread count)

```bash
python takeover_dns.py example.com 50
```

Where `50` is the number of threads to use (default: 50).

### Command Arguments

- `<domain>`: Target domain to scan (required)
- `<threads>`: Number of concurrent threads (optional, default: 50)

## üîÑ How It Works

The scanner operates in four phases:

### Phase 1: Subdomain Discovery
- Runs multiple subdomain discovery tools (subfinder, amass, assetfinder, findomain)
- Combines results to maximize coverage
- Saves discovered subdomains to file

### Phase 2: Subjack Analysis
- Runs subjack on discovered subdomains
- Uses fingerprinting to detect vulnerable services
- Identifies known takeover patterns

### Phase 3: Custom Vulnerability Analysis
- Performs DNS resolution for each subdomain
- Checks HTTP/HTTPS responses
- Analyzes content for takeover signatures
- Examines CNAME records for cloud service patterns

### Phase 4: Results and Reporting
- Generates comprehensive security report
- Saves results to JSON file
- Creates interactive HTML report
- Provides actionable recommendations

## üìä Output Files

The scanner generates three types of output files:

1. **Subdomain List** (`{domain}_subdomains.txt`)
   - Plain text list of discovered subdomains
   - Useful for further analysis or manual inspection

2. **Detailed Results** (`{domain}_takeover_results.json`)
   - Complete JSON export with all findings
   - Includes DNS records, HTTP responses, vulnerability status
   - Suitable for integration with other tools

3. **Security Report** (`{domain}_security_report.html`)
   - Interactive HTML report
   - Categorized by vulnerability severity
   - Visual indicators for vulnerable subdomains
   - Includes recommendations and remediation steps

## üîé Vulnerability Detection

The scanner detects vulnerabilities by analyzing:

1. **DNS Records**: Checks CNAME records pointing to cloud services
2. **HTTP Responses**: Looks for error messages indicating unused resources
3. **Status Codes**: Identifies suspicious error codes (404, 403)
4. **Content Analysis**: Searches for platform-specific error messages
5. **Service Fingerprinting**: Matches against known vulnerable patterns

### Vulnerability Confidence Levels

- **HIGH**: Multiple indicators confirm takeover vulnerability
- **MEDIUM**: Some indicators suggest potential vulnerability
- **LOW**: Initial suspicion, requires manual verification

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `subfinder not found`
```bash
# Ensure Go is installed and subfinder is in your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

**Issue**: `amass not found`
```bash
# Install amass from GitHub releases
# https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/releases
```

**Issue**: SSL verification warnings
- The tool disables SSL verification by default for scanning purposes
- Ensure you're using this only in authorized testing scenarios

**Issue**: Timeout errors
- Large domains may require longer scan times
- Adjust thread count based on your system capabilities

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Run scans during off-peak hours** to minimize impact
2. **Use appropriate thread counts** based on target infrastructure
3. **Regular scanning**: Schedule monthly scans for your domains
4. **Monitor new subdomains**: Set up alerts for newly discovered subdomains
5. **Document findings**: Maintain a record of vulnerable subdomains and remediation actions

## üîí Remediation

If vulnerabilities are found:

1. **Immediate Action**: Investigate all VULNERABLE subdomains
2. **Remove Unused Records**: Delete DNS records for unused subdomains
3. **Implement Monitoring**: Set up automated subdomain monitoring
4. **Use CAA Records**: Prevent unauthorized certificate issuance
5. **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic vulnerability scans
